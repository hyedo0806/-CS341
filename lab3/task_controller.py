# KAIST CS341 SDN Lab Task 2, 3, 4
#
# All functions in this file runs on the controller:
#   - init(net):
#       - runs only once for network, when initialized
#       - the controller should process the given network structure for future behavior
#   - addrule(switchname, connection):
#       - runs when a switch connects to the controller
#       - the controller should insert routing rules to the switch
#   - handlePacket(packet, connection):
#       - runs when a switch sends unhandled packet to the controller
#       - the controller should decide whether to handle the packet:
#           - let the switch route the packet
#           - drop the packet
#
# Task 2: Getting familiarized with POX 
#   - Let switches "flood" packets
#   - This is not graded
# 
# Task 3: Implementing a Simple Routing Protocol
#   - Let switches route via Dijkstra
#   - Match ARP and ICMP over IPv4 packets
#
# Task 4: Implementing simple DNS censorship 
#   - Let switches send DNS packets to Controller
#       - By default, switches will send unhandled packets to controller
#   - Drop DNS requests for asking cs341dangerous.com, relay all other packets correctly
#
# Task 5: Implementing simple HTTP censorship 
#   - Let switches send HTTP packets to Controller
#       - By default, switches will send unhandled packets to controller
#   - Additionally, drop HTTP requests for heading cs341dangerous.com, relay all other packets correctlys

    # Packet consists of:
    #  - various protocol headers
    #  - one content
    # For example, a DNS over UDP packet consists of following:
    # [Ethernet Header][           Ethernet Body            ]
    #                  [IPv4 Header][       IPv4 Body       ]

    #                                           [DNS Content]
    # POX will parse the packet as following:
    #   ethernet --> ipv4 --> udp --> dns
    # If POX does not know how to parse content, the content will remain as `bytes`
    #     Currently, HTTP messages are not parsed, remaining `bytes`. you should parse it manually.
    # You can find all available packet header and content types from pox/pox/lib/packet/

    # If you want to send packet back to switch, you can use of.ofp_packet_out() message.
